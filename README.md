## A beautiful way to view video

> NotchArt is a video app that focus on the way you watch your videos, with a clutter free and minimalist design. The video screen is completely free of everything except the slider, which is carefully built in the least intrusive way humanly possible. Now with NotchArt, no more buttons, sliders and ad marks above your favourite artists. Now how will you do anything without any buttons? Well, everything has been moved to gestures. Technologies like 3D touch, multi-touch and custom algorithms are used to provide a seamless and easy to use interface.
